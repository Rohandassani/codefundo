WARNING TO THE AREAS PRONE TO ANY DISASTER (PARTICULARLY FLOODS) BY USING CLIMATE CHANGE DATA


NATURAL DISASTERS ARE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT, GROWING MORE SEVERE AND AFFECTING MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER BEFORE.
THE WORLD WATCH INSTITUTE REPORTED THAT IN 2007 ALONE THERE WERE 874 WEATHER RELATED DISASTER WORLD WIDE.AS A RESULT, DEVELOPING THE TOOLS, PROCESSES AND BEST PRACTICES TO MANAGE NA TURAL DISASTERS MORE EFFECTIVELY IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY URGENT GLOBAL PRORITY.

THERE ARE MANY OFFICIAL SITES THAT REGULARLY UPDATE THE WEATHER FORECAST.WE CAN ANALYSE THE DATA PROCURED FROM THESE SITES AND ON THE MAP, WE CAN MARK THE MORE AFFECTED AREAS BY PREVIOUS YEAR DATAS TO EFFECTIVELY LIMIT OUR ANALYSIS TO THOSE AREAS.
WE CAN INSTALL SUCH A DEVICE THAT MAINTAINS A CONSTANT UPDATES OF THE RIVER SPEED, ITS WATER LEVEL.
BY PROCURING DATA OF RAINFALL LEVEL, WE CAN MAKE A DEVICE THAT COMBINES ALL THE DATA AND SET A WATER LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IF IT RAINS CAN MARK THE AREA AS IN DANGER.


CONCLUSIONâ€”IF IN THIS WAY WE CAN DESIGN A WEB APP ,THAT CAN MONITOR THE WATER LEVEL, FLOOD WARNING CAN PROTECT A LOT OF LIVES.
